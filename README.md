# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Supervised-Learning-Classification-Example-Template-Code

Original code came from Module 3, Classification, of IBM's Machine Learning with Python Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python#modules).

What I added to the project:
- Created ten rows of new data
- Update KNN model to predict 'custcat' for new data
- Export results to CSV
- Plot data with two types of 3d plots

Use this code to train and test KNN models on your own data as well as create new data to forecast classification categories and check model accuracy.
